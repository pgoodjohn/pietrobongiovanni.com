## Mollie

### Mollie Connect

Building the Mollie Connect proposition has been bringing forward some very interesting engineering challanges.

We're trying to adapt Mollie's core business flows (and therefore code flows) to a set of customers with very diverse needs where almost everyone is an exceptional case.

## Self Hosting

I don't (yet) have space for a rack anywhere in my house, so I am using a Digital Ocean droplet to host a bunch of applications (including this website) that I use day in an day out.

It's been, and still is, a great learning experience throughout the past year, and there are a lot of great self hosted application that you can run which can to a good enough job to save you from some subscription hell.
