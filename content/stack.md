## Hardware

**M1 Macbook Pro**
I have adored this machine since the first moment I got it. It's everything I always wanted in a laptop packed in a very nice looking package.

**iPhone 13 Pro Max**
Some people like Android phones, some people like iPhones. I like iPhones. I don't see the need of getting a new one every year though.

**Apple Watch Series 4 (I think)**
I really enjoy my Apple Watch. I am very careful of which notifications I let through, so it doesn't get too much in the way, and I really enjoy using it as a workout helper.

**iPad Air 2021**

**Raspberry PI (2x 4B 2GB, One ZeroW)**
Raspberry PIs are great to just tinker around or if you want something to set and forget. I have one set to run the little smart home devices I have with HomeAssistant, one hooked up to my TV that I can play with Shadow Gaming on it and one running PiHole.

## Software

## MacOS

### Programming

**Alacritty**
I don't have a particular reason for using this over any other terminal emulator. I downloaded it one day and I liked the look and feel of it so I just stuck with it.

**tmux**
It doesn't really matter what terminal emulator I use or whatever fancy shortcuts they might have because I now just live inside tmux windows any time am working in a terminal.

**vim**
vim is fantastic. If you take the time to learn even just a little bit of it you'll start finding it more and more useful and in the blink of an eye you'll find yourself writing custom folding rules because you are now taking your notes with it.

**VS Code**
While vim is still really good, VS Code is also not too bad.

**PHPStorm**
I only use PHPStorm when I am working on Mollie code. It has great integration with testing and debugging tools out of the box, and there are people who's job is to make sure they work so that is a no brainer.
